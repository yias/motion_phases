This repository contains the code used in the paper "Deacoding the grasping intention from Electromyography during reaching motions"

More over it contains the following folders:

1) the folder classification contains matlab functions for training different classifiers (SVM, ESN and LDA) with the EMG signals as described in the paper

2) the folder "statistical_analysis" contains the matlab functions for the statistical analysis that presented in the paper

3) the folder visualizations contains the matlab function for modeling the phases of the motions as described in the paper

4) the folder CAPS_slaves contains the python scripts which were used for the real-time evaluation

The matlab functions have two dependences: a) the SVM library SVM and b) the ESN matlab toolbox
